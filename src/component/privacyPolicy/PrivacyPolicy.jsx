          personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is
          information like name or email address that can by itself be used to
          contact you or identify who you are) with advertising, measurement, or

          partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their
          advertising without providing information that personally identifies
          you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not
          personally identify you.
